        Traders simply fill out a short form providing their name, location, and a brief description of the unsold secondhand clothes they want to be
        collected. Once submitted, their pickup request is added to a list that recyclers can access. This system allows recyclers to know where and when to
        come pick up these items efficiently.

    <div class="recyclers">
      <img src="images/recyclers screen.png" alt="Recyclers" />
      <p>
        Recyclers monitor the list of pending pickup requests submitted by traders. Each request includes the traderâ€™s name, location, and a description of the
        clothes awaiting pickup. When recyclers are ready, they visit the specified location to collect the unsold clothes as per the request.
